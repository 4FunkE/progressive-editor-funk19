# Progressive Editor Funk

## Description

### Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a web-based text editor that operates within a web browser, offering users a convenient and accessible platform for creating and editing text content. This text editor will adhere to Progressive Web App (PWA) standards, providing an enhanced user experience, including offline functionality and data persistence.

### Motivation:
- The motivation behind this project is to provide users with a downloadable text editor that they can use on their own devices. This enables users to have a reliable and feature-rich text editing tool accessible without the need for installation from an app store or software download.

### Project Objectives:
- PWA Compliance: The project's primary goal is to meet the criteria for Progressive Web Apps, ensuring that users can seamlessly interact with the text editor in their web browsers, even in offline environments.
- Data Persistence: To enhance reliability, the application will employ various data persistence techniques, including IndexedDB, to store and retrieve user data.
- Offline Functionality: Users will be able to use the text editor even when they are not connected to the internet.

### What the Project Solves:
- This project addresses the need for a lightweight, browser-based text editor that users can download and use on their devices without the traditional installation process. It simplifies the user experience and allows for offline access to text editing capabilities.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Throughout the project, I will gain valuable insights and skills related to web application development, including PWA implementation, data storage with IndexedDB, and offline functionality. The project will provide hands-on experience in creating a downloadable web application.

## Usage Instruction: 
#### Follow these steps to effectively utilize our application:
Access the Application:
- Open a web browser on your device (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Navigate to the URL where the text editor application is hosted.

Home Page:
- Upon accessing the application, you will be directed to the home page. Here, you can start using the text editor.
- If you lose internet connectivity or intentionally switch to offline mode, you can continue to work on your documents. The application operates offline thanks to its Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.
Data Persistence:

Download Documents:
- If you want to download a document to your local device, select the document and use the "Download" option from the menu.

Exit and Return:
- When you're finished using the application, you can simply close the browser or navigate away from the application's URL.
